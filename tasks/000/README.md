1. Click the "Use this template" button at the top of this repository to create a new repository from this template.
   If you need to decide, set your own user as the owner of the new repository.

   ⚠️ It's best if your new repository is **`public`**, as one of the tasks requires it.

2. Name the repository `gh-actions-workshop`

   ℹ️ This is not a requirement, but some of the tasks assume that this is the name.
   If you decide to use another name, keep in mind that you might have to change some of the commands in the tasks.

**If you're doing things locally**:

3. Clone your new repository
4. Open your new repository in your text editor

**If you're doing things on <https://github.dev>**:

3. Open your repository on <https://github.dev/[your-username]/gh-actions-workshop>

Now you're ready to go!
Please proceed to [task 1](../001/README.md).
